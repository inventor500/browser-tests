# Browser Tests
This is a simple HTML/JavaScript page for running tests on the browser. The purpose is to see what metadata can be found just using JavaScript.
This **DOES NOT** send the results of the tests to any remote server.

## Usage

Launch an HTTP server to serve the HTML page, e.g.

```shell
$ python -m http.server
```

Then navigate your browser to the page served by your HTTP server.

Unfortunately, browsers behave differently when visiting a file and visiting a server.
